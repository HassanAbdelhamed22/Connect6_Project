Connect Six Game Constants

This module defines constants used in a Connect Four game, including colors, player identifiers, and piece identifiers.

Colors:
- BLUE: RGB tuple representing the color blue.
- BLACK: RGB tuple representing the color black.
- RED: RGB tuple representing the color red.
- YELLOW: RGB tuple representing the color yellow.

Player Identifiers:
- PLAYER: Integer identifier for the human player.
- AI: Integer identifier for the artificial intelligence player.

Piece Identifiers:
- EMPTY: Integer identifier representing an empty slot on the game board.
- PLAYER_PIECE: Integer identifier representing a slot occupied by the human player's piece.
- AI_PIECE: Integer identifier representing a slot occupied by the artificial intelligence player's piece.

Usage:
- These constants can be imported into the main Connect Four game code to maintain consistency and readability.
- For example, to set a player's color:
    player_color = BLUE if current_player == PLAYER else RED
